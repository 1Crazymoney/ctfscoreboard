This is a basic CTF Scoreboard.

### Installation ###
1. Install Python with PIP and setuptools.  If you'd like to use a virtualenv,
   set one up and activate it now.
2. Install the dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Install a database library.  For MySQL, consider mysql-python.  For Postgres,
   use psycopg2.  (Others may work; untested.)
